# Fix GitHub Pages for Public Helm Repository

## Current Issue

Your GitHub Pages is configured as private, which prevents ArgoCD from accessing the Helm repository.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Make Repository Public (Recommended)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Go to Settings → General
3. Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
4. Click "Change repository visibility"
5. Select "Make public"
6. Confirm the change

### Option 2: Configure GitHub Pages for Public Access

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Make sure "Enforce HTTPS" is checked
3. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select "main" branch
5. Set folder to "/ (root)"
6. Save

### Option 3: Use GitHub Pages with Custom Domain

If you want to keep the repository private but make the Pages public:

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Add a custom domain (optional)
3. Make sure "Enforce HTTPS" is checked
4. The Pages will be public even if the repository is private

## Test the Repository

After making the changes, test the repository:

```bash
# Test direct access
curl -I https://jjoinvest.github.io/dex-apps/index.yaml

# Test with Helm
helm repo add dex-apps https://jjoinvest.github.io/dex-apps
helm repo update
helm search repo dex-apps
```

## Benefits of Public GitHub Pages

- ✅ **No authentication required** - ArgoCD can access without tokens
- ✅ **Simple setup** - No repository secrets needed
- ✅ **Reliable** - GitHub Pages is stable and fast
- ✅ **Free** - No additional costs

## Note

The Helm chart files themselves don't contain sensitive information, so making the repository public is safe for most use cases.
